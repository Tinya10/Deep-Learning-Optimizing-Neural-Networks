# Deep-Learning-Optimizing-Neural-Networks
In this project we are working on the Lending club dataset. Lending Club is a peer to peer lending company based in the United States, in which investors provide funds for potential borrowers and investors earn a profit depending on the risk they take (the borrowers credit score). Lending Club provides the "bridge" between investors and borrowers. For more basic information about the company please check out the wikipedia article about the company. From the given set of data we want to predict loan_status of the borrower. We have to predict the laon staus based on the features like Loan amount,payment plan,grade,verification status,recoveries etc. The loan status having the various categories like Fully paid,charged off,late,Issued,In a grace period etc. In the last assignment you have seen that how to apply the basic neural network on the dataset. In this project we will see how to optimize neural network in order to increase the training speed and how we can increase the accuracy.
